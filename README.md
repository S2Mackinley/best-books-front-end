## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  Ellis: front-end design, debugging
  Eli: ideas, brainstorming, knowledge based on JavaScript
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  Teaching each other our strengths. Eli can navigate and create ideas and Ellis can design most of the front-end side and look for bugs
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  Eli: Get more basic knowledge in code
  Ellis: Get better on communicating with partners
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  Make sure each person understands the flow of the code and ask questions when not understood.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  Suggest one another to contribute by dividing driver/navigator roles.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  Be open towards each other and as above divide roles.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  Take the time to explain when another is lost.
